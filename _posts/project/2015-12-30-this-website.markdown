#### This Website
This website is a small project I am doing, it is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}{{_}} a static website builder, the website is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript however by using Jekyll you don't need to write all the HTML for example once you have made the footer you can just include it in any page by writing {% raw %}`{% include footer.html %}`{% endraw %}, you can also use for loops and conditional statements in the HTML.

The image below shows the Jekyll code used to make the footer;

![alt text][My footer]

[My footer]: /assets/img/project/thiswebsite/footer.jpg "Image of my footer"

Also once the HTML, CSS and JavaScript have been made the content e.g. this post, can be made in Markdown a simple markup language the same markup used in the Reddit comment system, most Github READMEs and often throughout the internet. By using Markdown it makes it simple to publish pages as if you need to change any HTML on all webpages e.g. the footer you easily can.
